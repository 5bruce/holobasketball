# Holo Basketball

_Sample HoloLens app (adapted from "Basketball 3D" game)._

This is based on an example Unity game from a Build 2016 session:

* [Building a 3D Game with Unity and Visual Studio in 20 Minutes](https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2016/T607)

The original Unity game, Basketball 3D, is availble on GitHub:

* [Basketball 3D](https://github.com/harrywye/basketball3d)


The game has been modified to run on HoloLens.
It supports two input modes, [voice input](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/holographic/voice_input_in_unity) and [gesture](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/holographic/gestures_in_unity):

* You can shoot balls via voice commands, "Shoot" or "Throw", or
* by using the "tap" gesture.

If you are using an emulator, [the right mouse button corresponds to the tap gesture](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/holographic/using_the_hololens_emulator).


I wrote a simple blog post regarding this sample app:

### How to Get Started

Open the app folder, HoloBasketball, in Unity, and build it to create a Visual Studio solution.
Build the app in the visual studio, and then run the game in HoloLens device or emulator.
