# Holo Basketball

_Sample HoloLens app (adapted from "Basketball 3D" game)._

This is an example Unity game from a Build 2016 session:

* [Building a 3D Game with Unity and Visual Studio in 30 Minutes](https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2016/T607)

The Hoop asset was imported from this page:

* [Hoop 3D Model](http://archive3d.net/?a=download&id=efb427dd)


The game has been modified to run on HoloLens.
It supports two input modes, voice and gesture.
* You can shoot balls by voice phrases, "Shoot" or "Throw", and
* by "tap" gesture.


I wrote a simple blog post regarding this sample game:


* [Learning Unity3D in One Day](http://www.harrysmemo.com/post/143100753957/learning-unity3d-in-one-day)


### How to Get Started

Open the game folder, HoloBasketball, in Unity, and build it to create a Visual Studio solution.
Build the app in the visual studio, and run the game in HoloLens device or emulator.
