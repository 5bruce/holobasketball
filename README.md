# Holo Basketball

_Sample HoloLens app (adapted from "Basketball 3D" game)._

This is based on an example Unity game from a Build 2016 session:

* [Building a 3D Game with Unity and Visual Studio in 30 Minutes](https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2016/T607)

The original Unity game, Basketball 3D, is availble on GitHub:

* [Basketball 3D](https://github.com/harrywye/basketball3d)


The game has been modified to run on HoloLens.
It supports two input modes, voice input and gesture:

* You can shoot balls via voice commands, "Shoot" or "Throw", or
* by using "tap" gesture.


I wrote a simple blog post regarding this sample app:

* [Holo Basketball - My First HoloLens App](http://www.harrysmemo.com/post/143364651352/holo-basketball-my-first-hololens-app)



### How to Get Started

Open the game folder, HoloBasketball, in Unity, and build it to create a Visual Studio solution.
Build the app in the visual studio, and then run the game in HoloLens device or emulator.
